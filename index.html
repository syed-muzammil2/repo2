                  As mentioned earlier, insurance is a legal contract between the policyholder and the insurance provider. The insurance policy carries all the details about the aspects and conditions under which the insurance provider will pay out the insurance amount to the policyholder or their nominee in case an unforeseen event occurs. Insurance is a financial tool which helps in ensuring financial protection of yourself and your family. Generally the person who has purchased the policy also known as policyholder has to pay premiums for the coverage available under the insurance policy. 
                  Any person can seek insurance from an insurance company.

                  There are two ways in which you can make a claim:
Cashless claims:  Get in touch with your insurer and inform them about your claim. Depending on the type of insurance (motor/health), the insurer will guide you about the cashless claim settlement process. In case of motor insurance, the insurer shares the details of a nearby cashless workshop if available and you just have to pay your part of the liability to get your car/bike repaired. In case of health insurance, you can get in touch with your TPA (Third Party Administrator) help desk at the time of hospitalization for a cashless claim.Reimbursement claim:In case of unavailability of a cashless facility, you need to make a reimbursement claim. In case of motor insurance, you need to pay the entire claim amount up front (after informing the insurer of the claim) and get it reimbursed from the insurer after the repair of your car/bike. In case of health insurance, you need to pay the entire bill amount to the hospital (after informing the insurer) and get it reimbursed from the insurer post discharge from hospital.
